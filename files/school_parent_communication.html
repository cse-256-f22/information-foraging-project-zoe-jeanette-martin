      <h1>School/Parent Communication Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Commication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website, and emails
        give you information on current themes, activities, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
        emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child's adjustment, observations, and/or
        concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
        or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
      </p>

        </li>

      <p>
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family
        discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time
        during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
