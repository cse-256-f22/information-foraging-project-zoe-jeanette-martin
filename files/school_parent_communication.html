      <h1>School/Parent Communication Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Commication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website, and emails
        give you information on current themes, activities, and upcoming events. Phone calls and/or
        emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child's adjustment, observations, and/or
        concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher or the director, please email
        or call the office. Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.
      </p>
      
      <h1>
        Parent-Teacher Conferences
      </h1>
      <p>
        Assessment is an ongoing process at WUNS. Teachers interact with children in their play, conversation, and observations both
        in the classrooms and during outdoor play. Teachers keep notes on each child, writing about strengths and weaknesses in all areas
        of their development. Assessment includes checklists, timelines, and examples of the children's writings and pictures. Teaching teams
        meet weekly to discuss each child and plan activities in their program to enhance needed skills for children.	
      </p>
      <p>
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family
        discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time
        during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
