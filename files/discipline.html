      <h1>Discipline</h1>
      <h2>
        The staff and director at WUNS work to maintain a very positive and nurturing environment for each child. 
        Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible 
        providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, 
        keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe. 
      <p>

          The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children 
          of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct 
          behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they
           are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support 
           in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has 
           occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.

        Encouragement and pride in self is the basis of our discipline policy. Our aim is to have the 
        children manage their own actions and reactions. The teachers and staff will help children learn and 
        develop skills that they need to display appropriate behavior. This is done through: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Positive reinforcement. </li>
            <li> Anticipating unhealthy social interaction. </li>
            <li> Re-direction: guiding a child toward appropriate, socially positive activities. </li>
            <li> Naming and validating child’s feelings  </li>
            <li> Expressing disappointment or disapproval in a respectful and constructive manner. </li>
            <li> Simple, logical and immediate consequences.  </li>
          </ul>
